# MonvanDB

This is just a prove of concept project, that aims to clarify and dismistify some doubts that I had regarding Dabase Engines. I'll try to create a simple but usefull DB that must fulfill the following requirements:

- Handle multiple server connections simultaneously
- CRUD
- Handle multiple file access simultaneously
- Handle Joins 
- Cache Data
- Create tables
- Store files
- Be consistent
- Be relatively fast (Not to much because that is not my main goal)
- Have also a command line interface If I have the will to do it

All of this is going to be implemented in Golang. This choice was made because I wanted to develop my skills in this particular language. In spite of that, the architecture of software would remain the same in case someone would like to change the project to another language.
