# Crossroads

I was wondering if I should start refactoring what I had already done, such as binary trees, tables, and other objects, making them more efficient, faster, and more readable; or should I move forward and explore more paths to have a first minimal solution.

I decided to follow the fast-forward method to have all the basic features functional and then enhance them with the improvements. I know I had mentioned that at this point in the project I would be starting to develop cache and possibly dataframes, but now I am entering the season of greatest excitement and challenges that I can have. The system controls.

# Next steps and Architecture

In the next episodes I will cover a bit of the software architecture that I have been thinking about while developing the features that are present here. I will include diagrams and many other ideas that I had and the goals that I want to achieve. Soon after that, I will start developing the season (Arc for those who watch anime) of commands, which includes everything from the SQL interpreter to the Virtual Database Engine, the main core for executing queries. It will be great! I hope you will join me on this journey. Cheers!
